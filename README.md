# node-and-express
Springboard online bootcamp projects.  This is where focus changed from python to node, and eventually came to include express.
They were all done around January/February of 2021. A few can function in browser as is; the rest include the needed package.json files. 
As with most Springboard projects, they were completed as assignments and generally only meet the specified requirements, thus they may be unpolished and not handle all potential errors (although most projects here deal with backend APIs, so polish is less of a thing and at least some error handling is pretty much part of every assignment in this list).
